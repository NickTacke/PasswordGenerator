# Password Generator

Welcome to the Password Generator â€“ your solution for creating secure and easily usable passwords. I encountered challenges in generating multiple passwords that remain human-readable with the available free online tools. Consequently, I developed this tool to address that issue.

## Usage

To utilize this generator, specify the desired password length and the quantity of passwords needed. Click the "Generate" button to obtain your passwords.

## Development

After cloning the Git repository (ensure to delete the "build" folder intended for GitHub Pages) and installing dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), initiate a development server:

`pnpm run dev`

# Alternatively, start the server and open the app in a new browser tab or host it to open it on a othe device in the network

`pnpm run dev -- --open `

`pnpm run dev --host - --open`

#Production Build

To create a production-ready version of your app:

`npm run build`
